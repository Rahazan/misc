##KI150-2014 Assignment 1 *"Description real robot research project"*

###Project title
[**ROBOHOW.COG**](http://http://www.robohow.eu/) *Web-enabled and Experience-based Cognitive Robots that Learn Complex Everyday Manipulation Tasks*

###Goal
The goal of the project is to investigate a new approach to robot programming and control in human-scale manipulation activities. The plan is to create a system where a robot semi-atonomously adds instructions from a combination of kinesthetic teaching, internet instructions and demonstration to it's knowledge base.

RoboHow focuses on two scenarios for evaluation. The first is a meal preparation scenario, where the robot can perform basic cooking tasks. The second is an office service scenario in which the robot can for instance reload the paper of a printer.

### Beyond the state of art
Currently many tasks robots perform are part of human-programmed plan libraries. RoboHow proposes to go beyond the state of the art by enabling autonomous robots to expand it's repertoire by combining knowledge from various sources, from which a plan is constructed.

### Partners involved
Here I will highlight the main focus of the partners involved in the RoboHow project.
The project is divided into 9 work packages, each has a leading institution, which is also specified in the list below.

*  *Uni Bremen*  
The Universität Bremen (Germany)  will develop the (robot internal) representation of observations, knowledge and data, as well as methods for reasoning upon them for combining, learning and constraining them. From this, executable robot plans are transformed. 
The university of Bremen is also the leading partner in the project coordination and management work package.  
**Work Package 1: Representation**  
**Work Package 9: Project Coordination and Management**
* *Forth*  
The main objective of the Foundation for Research and Technology (Greece) in the RoboHow project is the extraction and representation of information from a demonstration video.  
**Work Package 2: Observation of Human Demonstrations**
* *KU Leuven*  
The Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium) focuses on the development of a system that generates movements for action specifications.  
**Work Package 3: Constraint- and Optimization-based Control**
* *KTH*  
The main role of Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (Sweden)  is related to sensory perception in work package 2 and 4. It takes the lead in the latter work package.  
**Work Package 4: Perception for Robot Action and Manipulation**
* *EPFL*  
The Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (Switzerland) is repsonsible for work package 5. This work package revolves around imitation learning, where a human demonstrates a task to the robot.  
**Work Package 5: Learning from Interaction with a Human**
* *TUM*  
The Technische Universität München (Germany) aims to develop a plan language used for representing and specifying behaviour of the robot. Also, it will develop prediction methods to fill gaps in incomplete specification.  
**Work Package 6: Plan-based Control**
* *CNRS*  
The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (France) will take the lead in architecture integration and robot benchmarking, as well as software guidelines and implementation policies.  
**Work Package 7: System Integration and Benchmarking**
* *Aldebaran*  
Aldebaran Robotics (France)  will assess the results achieved for future commercialization and prototyping. Also, it will foster participation in both the scientific community and among industry stakeholders.  
**Work Package 8: Dissemination and Outreach**
* *UL*  
The Universiteit Leiden (The Netherlands) does not take the lead on any of the work packages. It's main task will be the *translation of concepts and models from psychology and the cognitive neurosciences into an implementable cognitive-control architecture to generate both previously acquired and ad-hoc action plans.*

The project is mostly funded by the European Comission as part of *the Cognitive Systems and Robotics Initiative in the Seventh Framework Programme*.

### Status
The RoboHow project is still running, it started February 2012 and will run through January 2016. It's achievements are many, the [videos page](http://robohow.eu/videos) of the project provides short videos of demonstrations (which includes robotic roommates making pancakes, where the pancake mix is in the fridge at the start). 

The range of the topics in the [publications](http://robohow.eu/publications) of the project is huge. It really is an integration of many fields of study and techniques, from knowledge representation to planning, and from computer vision to the role of consciousness in action control.

Aside from publications, there is also products of the project in the form of [software](http://robohow.eu/software). The RoboHow software is all open-source, it includes for instance a 3D hand tracking library which tracks the position, orientation and articulation from markerless RGB-D cameras, and a plan language developed for the project (CRAM).
